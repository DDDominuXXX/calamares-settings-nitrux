efiBootLoader: "grub"

# GRUB 2 binary names and boot directory
# Some distributions (e.g. Fedora) use grub2-* (resp. /boot/grub2/) names.

grubInstall: "grub-install"
grubMkconfig: "grub-mkconfig"
grubCfg: "/boot/grub/grub.cfg"

# Optionally set the bootloader ID to use for EFI. This is passed to
# grub-install --bootloader-id.
#
# If not set here, the value from bootloaderEntryName from branding.desc
# is used, with problematic characters (space and slash) replaced.
#
# The ID is also used as a directory name within the EFI environment,
# and the bootloader is copied from /boot/efi/EFI/<dirname>/ . When
# setting the option here, take care to use only valid directory
# names since no sanitizing is done.
